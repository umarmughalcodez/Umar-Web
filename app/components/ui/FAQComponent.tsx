      question:
        "Why do I need a website for my pet grooming business when I already use Instagram?",
      answer:
        "While social media helps with visibility, a website builds trust, drives repeat bookings, and turns visitors into loyal clients. We design emotionally engaging, pet-owner–focused websites that reflect your brand and experience. Plus, we integrate smart features like appointment reminders and recurring visit notifications — helping you retain customers and keep your grooming schedule full every-time.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "I already have a Google Business or Yelp page — why do I need a separate website?",
      answer:
        "Those pages list your business — but a website shows your brand. With your own site, you control the design, showcase your work, take bookings, and rank on Google. Your page says you exist — your website proves you’re the best. 🐾",
    },

    {
      question: "How long will it take to get my pet grooming website ready?",
      answer:
        "We deliver fully functional, beautiful websites within just 2–3 weeks. Our streamlined process ensures fast turnaround without compromising quality — so your business can start welcoming new clients as soon as possible.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you provide website maintenance or updates after launch?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we offer affordable monthly subscription plans for every budget. These plans include regular content updates, performance checks, and SEO optimization to keep your website running smoothly and ranking higher on Google.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the cost of a website you design?",
      answer:
        "We keep it simple and budget-friendly for pet grooming businesses. You can choose our affordable monthly subscription that includes regular updates, ongoing SEO optimization, and 24/7 support — perfect for keeping your website fresh and growing. Or, if you prefer a one-time purchase, we’ll build and launch your site without monthly payments, so you fully own it from day one.",
    },

    {
      question: "Will my website be optimized for SEO?",
      answer:
        "Definitely. Every website we build is optimized for search engines from day one — including meta tags, fast loading speed, and mobile responsiveness. Plus, we continue to refine your SEO each month so your business stays visible and competitive online.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I want to add something new to my site later?",
      answer:
        "Of course! Simply contact us with the details of what you’d like to add — whether it’s a new service, a photo gallery, or a special offer — and we’ll update your site within 24 hours. Quick, professional, and hassle-free.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will my website look great on all devices?",
      answer:
        "Yes. All our websites are fully responsive and designed to look perfect on smartphones, tablets, and desktops — ensuring a smooth experience for your clients wherever they visit from.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I update my services, photos, or pricing myself?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. We provide a user-friendly content management system (CMS) so you can easily update your content anytime. We also offer quick training and support if you ever need help managing your site.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if no one is visiting my current website?",
      answer:
        "That’s exactly what we fix. Along with stunning design, we apply SEO strategies and conversion-focused layouts to help your website attract the right visitors — and turn them into real, paying clients.",
    },
    {
      question: "My old website still works — why invest in a new one?",
      answer:
        "Because your website is often your first impression. An outdated or slow site can make clients lose trust instantly. A modern, fast, and well-optimized website communicates professionalism, builds trust, and increases bookings.",
    },
    {
      question: "What makes your agency different from others?",
      answer:
        "We specialize in pet industry websites, understand your business needs, and deliver high-performing, visually stunning sites in just 2–3 weeks. You’ll enjoy flexible options — from one-time builds to affordable monthly plans with continuous support, updates, and SEO improvements. No generic templates, no hidden fees — just results that help your grooming business shine.",
